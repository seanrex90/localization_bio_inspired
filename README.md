# localization_bio_inspired
Localization is a method of finding unknown  nodes in the region. wireless sensor networks utilizes localization technique to find the location of nearby unknown nodesv location as GPS uses more energy and drains the energy soon instead of GPS , we opt for Localization methods such as Triangulation , trilateration , AOA , TOA , TDoA etc.
